Hello Sean

Here is my feedback: 
- explore either scappy or use ping3 to try to reach available device (online device). 
- create a secondary list consisting opf the devices that responded to output to another CSV file
This will ensure your program does both reading and writing!        
You are off to a great start! I have no doubt you can implement these requirements. 
Please work on these implementations and let me know if you have any questions. 

Best,
